Extended Python Calculator

An extended command-line calculator built with Python that supports both basic and advanced mathematical operations through a clean, menu-driven interface.

This project is beginner-friendly while demonstrating good programming practices such as modular design, structured input handling, and clear control flow.

Overview

The Extended Python Calculator performs a range of arithmetic operations, covering both basic calculations and commonly used advanced operations.

The application runs in the terminal and is organized using separate functions for each operation, making the code easy to read, maintain, and extend.

Supported Operations

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with division-by-zero handling)

Power (exponentiation)

Square root

Percentage calculation

Features

Interactive command-line menu

Input validation for numeric values

Safe handling of division by zero

Modular code structure with separate functions for each operation

Support for both single-input and two-input operations

Clean and readable output formatting

Beginner-friendly and easily extendable

About the Project

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of core Python concepts, including:

Functions and modular programming

Loops and conditional logic

User input handling

Error handling using exceptions

Designing clean control flow for CLI-based applications

By extending a basic calculator into a more feature-rich version, I gained practical experience in improving existing code while maintaining clarity and stability.

How to Run

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Run the program using the following command:
```bash
python calculator.py
